# Call of Duty - Gun Game

The (GMod) gamemode 'Call of Duty - Gun Game' is a remake of the gamemode 'Gun Game / All The Guns' of the 
popular game franchise Call of Duty®. 

<i>"Each player starts with the same basic pistol. Every time you kill an enemy with your gun, you're upgraded to the next weapon. Anyone killed with a melee attack is demoted to the previous weapon, so watch your flank. Suicides also set you back to the previous tier, most often occurring when using explosive weapons. The match ends when someone cycles through all twenty weapons. Success in Gun Game requires aggressive tactics and familiarity with each weapon in the rotation. Don't worry about dying - just go for a lot of successive kills."</i> <b>— Call of Duty ELITE description.</b>

## Requirements:<br/>
To play this gamemode you need at least 2 players. Additional addons and modules are required when using 
certain gamemode features.


## Features:<br/>
  * Custom HUD
  * Compatible with any map
  * Pre-made weapons & playermodels list
  * Settings file (dedicated servers only)
  * MySQL support (dedicated servers only)

## Addons:<br/>
As a dedicated server owner you can disable the usage of addons in the settings.lua file. If you use this gamemode
in a 'singleplayer' server, it will automatically switch to the default weapons if the additional addons are missing.


## MySQL support (dedicated servers only!):<br/>
For server owners who like to display game stats on their website / join screen, I added MySQL support. Certain game and 
player stats like wins, kills and deaths will be stored when this setting is enabled and configured properly.

For more info about the MySQL feature, please read <a href="https://github.com/LoveRenamon/Call-of-Duty-Gun-Game/blob/master/MYSQL.md">MYSQL.md</a>.


## Gamemode settings (dedicated servers only!):<br/>
The gamemode comes with a settings file where you can customize the addon to your liking. Things like weapons, playermodels,
round time and MySQL settings can be edited. Please make sure that if you edit the file, that you don't make a typo or else
the gamemode will break.

To view the settings file, please go to <a href="https://github.com/LoveRenamon/Call-of-Duty-Gun-Game/blob/master/SETTINGS.md">SETTINGS.md</a>.
